                <p>Hi, My name is Thanh Nguyen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="speech">
                <p>I came to the US in 2007 and since then, I have been working for restaurants and market around Hartford area in Connecticut (Pho
                    Boston- 5 years, Sushi California-10 years, 5 Star Farmer Market-5 years).
                    I'm a hard working person. I can't think of a time when I was out of work for more than a week or two in the last 15 years.
                    I believe in both working hard and working smart. I'm very good at multitasking and working in a fast-paced environment.
                    I love math, science, technology, computer and engineering. I studied General Study at Capital Community College from 2010-2015 but did not get a degree. Knowledge is my passion. I'm always trying to teach myself
                    new things and skills. This fun porfolio is an example. 
                    I'm good at problem-solving, critical thinking and communicating.
                    I used to do art like drawings, paintings, and building stuff with my hands like electrical circuit or toys ( when I was in
                    middle school and high school).
                    I'm very determined and thriving. Give me a task and I will get it done. I believe If you give me a chance to work for you, I
                    will not be a disappointment.
                    Thanks a lot for your time.</p>
